Internet of things is rapidly becoming central to our lives at homes,
office and even during travel. The driving factor for this rapid IoT
adoption is the huge market potential that this technology offers. A
cluster of low-bandwidth, memory-constrained devices offering a
networked service for low-power is a very attractive proposition,
which is incidentally the bedrock feature-set of IoT systems.

Large IoT systems mean large amount of data. Without right access,
communication, and decision policies this large data set is cause of
great concern. Any knowledge person with devious motivations can
easily orchesrtate an attack on an IoT system without security.  The
fundamental focus of this paper is to address the security concerns of
an IoT system.
